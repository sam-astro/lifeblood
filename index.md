# lifeblood
**lifeblood** is a hyperfocused Jekyll theme for documentation -- clean, customizable, cutesy.\
it's designed as the theme for [victus](https://sporeball.dev/victus)' documentation, while being available for all to use.

{: .note}
lifeblood is currently **in development!**  expect various changes to this site in the near future.

### quick start
if your site is hosted on GitHub Pages, you can add lifeblood to your site's `_config.yml` as a remote theme:

```yml
remote_theme: sporeball/lifeblood
```

### configuration
you'll want to use your pages' front matter to determine how your site's [navigation](docs/navigation) will appear.

also of note are the various [customization options](docs/customization) available, including both CSS and site variables.

#### acknowledgements
lifeblood is heavily inspired by the [Just the Docs](https://pmarsceill.github.io/just-the-docs) theme by [Patrick Marsceill](https://www.thismodernweb.com).\
it also borrows some ideas from [Water.css](https://watercss.kognise.dev) by [Kognise](https://kognise.dev).

the nav icon and site favicon are taken from the [Feather](https://feathericons.com) icon set by [Cole Bemis](https://colebemis.com).
